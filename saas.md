### üí° **Think of it like this:**
- **SaaS** = Renting a fully furnished apartment (just move in and use).
- **PaaS** = Renting a workspace where you bring your tools and build what you need.
- **IaaS** = Renting a plot of land ‚Äì you build everything from the ground up.
- **On-Prem** = Owning the land and building, maintaining everything yourself.
