# Bash Scripting Basics

## 1. What is a shell script?

A shell script is a plain text file containing a series of commands that are interpreted and executed by a shell (such as Bash) in a Unix/Linux environment. It allows automation and execution of multiple commands as a single unit.

## 2. How do you define a shebang in a Bash script?

The shebang (also known as a hash bang) is the first line in a Bash script and specifies the path to the shell interpreter. For example, `#!/bin/bash` indicates that the script should be executed using the Bash shell.

## 3. How do you pass command-line arguments to a Bash script?

Command-line arguments can be accessed within a Bash script using the special variables `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, and so on, where `$1` represents the first argument, `$2` represents the second argument, and so on. The `$0` variable represents the script name itself.

## 4. How do you read input from the user in a Bash script?

You can use the `read` command to read input from the user within a Bash script. For example:

```bash
read -p "Enter your name" name
```

This prompts the user to enter their name and stores it in the `name` variable.

## 5. How do you use conditional statements in Bash scripts?

Bash scripts support conditional statements such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`. For example:

```bash
if [ "$variable" -eq 10 ]; then
    echo "Variable is equal to 10"
elif [ "$variable" -gt 10 ]; then
    echo "Variable is greater than 10"
else
    echo "Variable is less than 10"
fi
```

## 6. How do you use loops in Bash scripts?

Bash scripts support loops such as `for`, `while`, and `until`. For example:

```bash
for i in 1 2 3; do
    echo "Number $i"
done

counter=1
while [ $counter -le 10 ]; do
    echo "Counter $counter"
    ((counter++))
done
```

## 7. How do you define and use functions in Bash scripts?

Functions in Bash scripts are defined using the `function` keyword or by directly naming the function. For example:

```bash
# Using the function keyword
function greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Directly naming the function
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

# Calling the function
greet "John"
```

## 8. How do you handle errors and exceptions in Bash scripts?

Error handling in Bash can be done using the `trap` command to catch signals and the `set -e` option to exit the script on any error. Additionally, you can use conditional statements and error codes (`$?`) to handle specific errors and take appropriate actions.

## 9. How do you comment lines in a Bash script?

Comments in Bash scripts are indicated using the `#` symbol. Anything after the `#` symbol on a line is considered a comment and is ignored during script execution.

## 10. How do you redirect standard input, output, and errors in Bash scripts?

You can use redirection operators to redirect standard input (`<`), standard output (`>`), and standard error (`2>` or `&>`). For example:

```bash
command > output.txt
```

This redirects the output of `command` to a file named `output.txt`.
